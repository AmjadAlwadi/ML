Method, Editing time for 1 norm 1 beam, Full time for 1 norm 1 beam     


WISE, 44.6 min, ?
ROME, 7.5 min, 8.1 min
R-ROME, 4.3 min, 5 min
GRACE, 4.3 min, 4.7 min
MELO, 2.6 min, 3.6 min
LORA, 1,2 min, 1.6 min
FT-L, 1 min, 1.5 min
FT-M, 0.7 min, 1.1 min
IKE, 0 min, 28s, 69.12s, 92s

MEND, 19s, 1 beam: 43s, 5 beams: 115s, 10 beams: 155s

only beams <= 3 it's possible to get in reasonable time


10 for 1 seq_edit
2 for 2
2 for 3
2 for 4
2 for 5
2 for 10

this 2 times because 2 models

would like to evaluate model with opencompass tool for example but the overhead will be too large
it takes according to my estimations about 1h to evaluate for 1 model for one metric/dataset
so in terms of saving the post-edit-model into disk and time consumption this needs to much resources



improved times with sequential generation instead of batching
For 15 beams full code:
MEND: 163.73s

For 10 beams (15 doesn't work) full code:
IKE: 325.69s

For 15 beams full code:
FT-M: 170s

For 15 beams full code:
FT-L: 177s

For 15 beams full code:
LORA: 235s
